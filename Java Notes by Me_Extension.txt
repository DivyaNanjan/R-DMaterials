JAVA
Serilaisation

When we are playing the game and wanna quit we will save the game.(there we will save the state of object. not whole object will store the values)
will be saving data in file(not data save the state of object)
instead of dataouputstream   ObjectOutputStream

The String class and all the wrapper classes implements java.io.Serializable interface by default. 

*****Serialization in java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte stream.

***** Saving the state of an object in a file is known as serialization. 
Rather than serializing Java objects to binary format we can serialize them to XML documents which is human readable

_________________________________________________________

servlet is actually a java class resides on tomcat instance
tomncat acts as a container
*******Tomcat is repsonsible tocreate servlet object and req and resp objects
Every hit tomcat creates a new req and resp object
Servlet obj are reused(different req have differenct threads not instances) will be useful for less resources

********* HTTP is stateless protocol. It wont store our data then whoi will save the data ?? Session objects :)

ApplicationContext : access the application
Sevlet path        : servlet mapping
localhost:8080/ApplicationContext/servlet path
localhost:8080 tomcat instance running 

****************** Session obj will be created per user/machine(only one browser)
**** Context Object is more than session where the obj is shared acros all servlet and users ie thru out the application


*******JSP******
java inside HTML  write as <% %>    expression <%=k >   declaration <%! %>   <%@ for import %> @ directive
1. jsp for printing out.println  (for printing varibale )   <%=varibalename %>
	but in servelts we need to create object for printwriter and obj.println

2. Every JSP is a servlet created by tomacat . Tomcat converts JSP to servlet
3. every scriptlet code added to doGet method of servlet
4. what ever we keep in declaration will be outside doGet
5 . static codes html  are written into out.write 
6.  another directive <%@ include file = "test.jsp" %>
7 we have implicit objects request session application(ServletContext in servlet)


***************
response.sendRedirect()  soon after we submit from login.jsp browser a hit to Servelt(1st call) and the n Servelt and then browser will redirect to succ3ess.jsp  
						So we cant save the data in request object two URLs . So save the data in session

response.requestDispatcher()  Browser donno it is a new request.	 Server itself will pass request o success.jsp. Only one call   responsedispatch rd = request.getRequestDispatcher()  rd.forward("request","response")  
							  We can save the data in request obj itself
