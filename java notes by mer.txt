Objects(instance) are created in heap memory
A obj = new A()  [new A() will create obj in heap memory]

Cant use non static variables inside static method

Runtime polymorphism,

Dynamic Method Dispatch Deciding which method shud call in runtime
A obj= new A()
B obj1 = new B()

A a;
a=obj1
a.show() show B will be printed
a=obj
a.show   show A will be printed

Parent child
base derived
Super sub+
________________________________________________________________

Final key word can be used for variable method class

Cant override a method if v use Final
Cant extend a class if v use Final before class
final int i=6; i++ is not possibel
Only one time assignment is possible

___________________________________

This KeyWord
it is a current instance. If we have 5 objects at one point we r working with one obj. and this is will be that current instance

_________________________________________
Abstract methods are only declared but not defined
cant create an object for abstract cls
abstract cls can have abstract methods 
__________________________________________

abstract class MaheshPhone
{
  public void call()
   {
     sysout("for calling feature");
   }
   public  abstract void move(); //but he donno how to implement move ,dqance so as we dopnno implementation we can make it abstract
   public abstract void dance();//as they are abstract methos class shud be abstract
   public abstract void cook(); // canot instantiate the abstract class means cant create obj for abstract class

}


abstract class RameshPhone extends MaheshPhone(define all abstract methods)

{
    public void move()
	sysout("Moving ")// some how he implemented but failed to dance andd cook
      
	  public abstract void dance()
     public abstract void cook()



}


class SureshPhone extends RameshPhone  //concrete class 
{
  public dance()
  sysout
  public cook ()
  sysout() 
  So we can able to create object for SureshPhone

abstract     interface(provide multiple interface every method is abstract by default no need to mention explictly)

class               interface(not a class)
declare method       declare
define is possible    not possible
cant create object    same
extends 				implements 
interface supports multiple inheritence

*** Marke Interface -- without any methods
****Single Abstract Method SAM -- only one methd (Functional Interface)
***** Normal 
_________________________________________
class A extends B implements C

B and C have method called show
Now B class has more power than interface C.
So o/p of B show methos will be executed
___________________________________

In java if we print object 
it will call to string methiod.
If in our class toString method is not there it will call the Object class toStringMethod

EXCEPIONS
top class is throwable ()
subclasses are Exception(can be handled by us)  Checked and Unchecked
				Error(cant be handlwed) RAM out of memory,JVM not working properly

				
Throwable class is used handle all exceptions and error
extended by two main classes exceptions and errors
exceptions --- v can handle 
errors     ---- v cant handle memory leaking in JVM CPU not working 				

exceptions  -- checked a. IO(inputs from user)   b. SQL   net beans itself knows
			-- unchecked  Runtime exceptions(Array index out of bund , file not found )
			
critical statements will be under """try""" block
multiple catches with one try block
keep last catch as exception

****Finally block : even if the error comes i want to print some thing then write that code in final block
					need to close our resources at finally block
					
** SUPRESSING THE ERRORS  by using """throws""" keyword(it wont handle the error just supressing the error)


shallow copying obj1 = obj
deep copying    obj1. i  = obj.i    obj1. j = obj . j  copy each and evry variables
cloning obj1 = obj.clone()      clone (){ return super.clone}


------------------------------------------------------

Collections and Generics

Collection -- interface  
Collection values  = new ArrayList()  ArrayList is a class whcih implemts List(a interfae) which implements Collections

Collection<Integer> = new ArrayList<Integer>()

List implements Collection
List works with index number,have duplicates , 

Set<Integer> numbers = HashSet<Integer>()  Set is a interface HashSet is a class which implements Set, 
Set           number = TreeSet<Integer>() Sorted Format
Map<key,value>


Two ways to fetch values  a.Iterator  b.Enhanced Forloop
Collection values = new ArrayList()
Iterator i = values.iterator()
while(i.hasNext())
{
 i.next()
}

In Collections we cant add values at required postion values.add(1,33)  cant add 33 at 1st place
So List Came

Collections.sort()

Vectors increases the capatcity dependng on the user input  v.capacity() 
Vector<Integer> v = new Vector<Integer>()   //Thread safe increases capactiy by 100% //slow
ArrayList                                   //Thread not safe increases cap   by 50% // fast

Linked list follows double linked List concnept has previous node and and next node only 2 nodes are effected 
Array lsit   follows  dynamic Array  When we add an elements entire numbers are effected (for fastng fetch)

Set wont allow duplicates   Set values = new HashSet<>()   using some hashin algorithm wont save in proper sequence
											 TreeSet
							Set<String> keys = values.keySet()  get all the keys				 
Inner class
Member inner class --> class A{ 
								classB {} }  now A obj = new A()   A.B obj1 = obj.new B();    so after compilation we will get A.class A$B class as byte code 
Static inner class  ---> class A { 
								static class B{ } now A.B obj1 = new A.B()  no need to create object for A since B is static 

Annonymous inner class --> class A { public show display() sysout("printing "}
							main ()
							{
							 A obj = new A(){
									 public void display()
									 sysout("Displaying printing")
									
									}
							 obj.display() will do the recent one
							}
							
cookies -- temporary local storage



JSP          SERVLET
<html>
<body>

</body>
<%  is called scriptlet which goes under service method in servlet %>   scriplet
<%!  this is called declaration comes above service method   %>    declaration
<%@ page import ="java.utili.Data" %>  directive
<% =    goes to out.println in servlet %>   expression
</html>

Client req --> Controller --> Service class --> DAO (interacts with DB) --> DB  -->  Controller gives the view as JSP by giving some data (POJO object as model)

File iputStream fis
DatainputStrem  dis
dis.readUTF()

JDBC - java data base connectivity
1. importing of packages            java.sql.*
2.Load and register(class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.driver") the drivers      driver for mysql is com.mysql.jdbc.driver (jar file mysql-connector)
3.Establsihing connection      instantiate the interface called Connection
4.Create statment              st(Predefined queries , prepartd statemnt(for dynamic Queries , callable(Stored procedures)
5.Execute Query                st.executeQuery(select * from employee)

Hibernate
ORM object relational mapping tool object relation to persisting (saving of data)
Object world --> Relation world(Rows and colums)
1. class is table
2. object is rows
Few ORM tools ibatics,JPA
saving of a object can be done with sessionobject  (can get from SessionFactory)0

-----------------
normal mvc
req -- controller -- data from db in form of model -- showed ad view

spring mvc
big apps multiple controller --> for different tasks
to handle those many there will be front controller( Dispatcher Servlet)
soon after we hit a req goes to web.xml 

________________________________________________________
We can get the Beans
from Beanfactory(small app) and ApplicationContext (super set of beanfactory)
Can deifne beans either in XML bsed configuration or Annotation based Configuration
@Autowire    search for object itself
@Qualifier("1st Object") search for name
@Component  for specifying class object
@Configuration   for configuration
@Component-Scan   scans all components
